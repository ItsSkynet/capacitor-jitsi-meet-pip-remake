## Jitsi Infrastructure Requirements
This plugin is made to integrate with Jitsi Meet, It is possible to run this plugin with https://meet.jitsi.si, however Jitsi warns developers to use it ONLY for development purposes due to service configuration not apt for production. Meetings created with development environment will be limited to 5 minutes. Additionally, development environment no longer allows anonymous conferences as stated in their blog published on Aug 22, 2023: [Authentication on meet.jit.si](https://jitsi.org/blog/authentication-on-meet-jit-si/)

For production please use either one of these solutions below:
- [JaaS - Jitsi as a Service](https://jaas.8x8.vc/) - PAIDüí≤
- [Self hosting](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/) - FREE Software, requires a server to host
